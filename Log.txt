#This is a log of what was done in this project
1. Clean the data using Python (Jupyter Notebooks):
	1.1 import data from CSV into my notebook and put data into a data 	frame using pandas
	1.2 drop rows with missing values
	1.3 remove duplicate rows
	1.4 Convert columns to appropriate data types
		1.4.1 Convert CustomerID to numeric int instead of float
		1.4.2 Convert UnitPrice to numeric
		1.4.3 Convert Quantity to numeric
		1.4.4 Convert InvoiceDate to datetime
	1.5 Make sure every number Quantity column is a positive integer and 	delete any wrong values
	1.6 Replace commas with underscores in the Description column as they 	were interfering with the structure of the csv file
	1.6 Create a new column Total as the sum of Quantity and UnitPrice
	1.7 Reset the index of the DataFrame
	1.8 Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file 	online_retail_df_cleaned.csv

2. Explore and analyze data using SQL (SQL Server Management Studio 19):
	2.1 Create a new database
	2.2 Create a new table
	2.3 Fill the table with data from cleaned csv
	2.4 Do some select queries to explore data
		2.4.1 Select Expensive items (over 100) and order by price
		2.4.2 Select Large orders (over 1000 in total) and order by 		total
		2.4.3 Select orders in Portugal during July
		2.4.4 Select orders that have Glass and silver in the 			description
		2.4.5 Select the 10 most paying customers and their countries
		2.4.6 select average sales every month
3. Analyze data using Excel:
	3.1 Export data from CSV file to Excel
	3.2 Create a new sheet to put statistics in
		3.2.1 Calculate Mean, Median, and Mode for Quantity, 			price, and total
		3.2.2 Calculate Standard Deviation for Population and 			Population Variance for Quantity, price, and total
		3.2.3 Calculate Min and Max for Quantity, price, and 			total
	3.3 Create Pivot Tables
		3.3.1 Create a pivot table to count the occurrences 			of each Customer ID
		3.3.2 Create a pivot table to count the occurrences 			of each Country
		3.3.3 Create a pivot table to count the occurrences 			of each Product
	3.4 Apply Regression Analysis to Unit price and total
	3.5 Create a pivot table to group invoice dates by month and 		create a line visualization to show total sales per month
4. Create Visualizations using Power BI:
	4.1 Create a Map Visualization for Total Sales by Country
	4.2 Create a bar chart for most selling products by Quantity
	4.3 Create a line chart for total sales by month and year
	4.4 Create a bar chart for most selling products by Total sales
	4.5 Create Measures:
		4.5.1 Create a measure to calculate the highest sales country
		4.5.2 Create a measure to calculate the total value of sales 		in the dataset
		4.5.3 Create a measure to calculate the number of unique 		customers
		4.5.4 Create a measure to calculate the number of total 		orders
		4.5.5 Create a measure to calculate the Average order value
		4.5.6 Create a measure to calculate the total quantity sold

	4.6 Create a dashboard:
		4.6.1 add some of the visualizations:
			4.6.1.1 Map Visualization for Total Sales by Country
			4.6.1.2 Bar chart for most selling products by 				Quantity
			4.6.1.3 Line chart for total sales by month and year
		4.6.2 add some of the measures as cards:
			4.6.2.1 The Highest Sales Country
			4.6.2.2 The total value of sales
			4.6.2.3 The number of unique customers
			4.6.2.4 The number of total orders
			4.6.2.5 The Average Order Value
			4.6.2.6 the total quantity sold
